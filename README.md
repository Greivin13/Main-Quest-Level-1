# Main-Quest-Level-1

## Description

In this challenge, we were given the task to refactor intex.HTML into semantic HTML. For a better understanding of the structure. As it goes hand to hand we also had to make sure CSS matched the modified elements on the HTML structure. This challenge gave me a better understanding of how important it is to have a well structured HTMl.

## Installation
